Im creating this file to document the progress of the Security Agreement:

From my limited understanding it would appear that a security agreement or security structure is the mechanism by which the lender can retain ownership of the project (spv) should the borrower default.  

Project finance lenders rely on project cash flows. The lenders’ security arrangements and protection mechanisms reflect this and consist mainly of:

Secured interests over all the project assets (including and especially all contracts) to enable the lenders to take remedial actions if the Company has failed;

Controls over all cash inflows and outflows of the Company. As noted above, loan contracts and other financing documents will establish the waterfall for allocating the Company's cash inflows to the various cost items. This will ensure that senior debt service always has priority. In addition, it will define the circumstances in which senior lenders are able to prevent equity distributions (“lock up”). This will usually be defined by reference to financial ratios such as ADSCR;[6]

Cash flow controls in the form of reserve accounts (e.g. debt service reserve account, maintenance reserve account).

Im still updating this document so please bear with me...
