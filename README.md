Stakeholders:

Special Purpose Vehicle,
Lenders,
Security Trustee (Our Team),
Contractor,
Off takers,
Shareholder 1,
Shareholder 2.

Our objective is to create a CorDapp to replicate the actions of the Security Trustee.

The functions of a security trustee are to act as a custodian for the following:
Loan Agreement (From the Lenders)
Security Agreements (from the SPV)
Direct Agreements (from Off Taker and Contractor)



From the diagram on the wiki, it would appear that we are not actually ‘producing’ any documents at all, the docs/certificates above are supplied to us from other stakeholders, we simply acts as a custodian for the loan agreement, security agreements and direct agreements.

However we did agree to take on the security agreements, so we should attempt to replicate a security agreement but as a smart contract + legal prose.  That contract would be sent from the SPV to us as the security trustee.

What is a Security Trustee?

A security trustee is the entity holding the various security interests created on trust for the various creditors, such as banks or bondholders. This structure avoids granting security separately to all creditors which would be costly and impractical.

How does project finance work?

Project financing is a loan structure that relies primarily on the project's cash flow for repayment, with the project's assets, rights and interests held as secondary collateral. 

What is Limited recourse Debt?

Non-recourse financing means the borrowers and shareholders of the borrower have no personal liability in the event of monetary default.
